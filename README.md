### Description

GardenMate is a simple and easy to use task management application. The application's main page has different views depending on whether the user is logged in as ordinary user or as an admin. For an ordinary user the application provides an easy to read list of tasks for a specified working day. Each task is displayed on a card with relevant information regarding the task such as client name and address. The user can also navigate to a task’s address by clicking on the location icon in the task card. There is a checkbox for the user to mark a task as complete as well as an export option to export the day’s task to a .csv file. When logged in to the application as an admin the user is given a more comprehensive menu of options and is able to view other users, add tasks to a user, add a new user and delete a user. The application is responsive and scales for viewing on handheld devices.
